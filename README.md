Every look in RIPPS2 is a theme folder away: a <code>conf_theme.cfg</code>, 8-bit PNGs, fonts and sounds.<br>
No ELF to rebuild. Rely on the build, theme it.</p>

## The themes

| Theme | Look | Needs RIPPS2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Adapt** / **Adapt Rx** | akilluminati47's Adapt (RiptOPL): each game's art under frosted glass (zoomed, not stretched, in 16:9) with Adapt's side bar as a frosted strip on the left, the game's cover in RIPPS2's case with its reflection and the disc on one side, the list on clear glass on the other (Rx swaps the list and the case, and puts LAUNCH DISC at the right of the bar, over its disc). The disc always sits right under LAUNCH DISC. Info page on clear glass with 4:3 screenshots, tipping with the right stick as one sheet; page morphs between them, Settings over the pillars, no towers on the game pages. No sounds of their own (from 10/12/2026): your AUDIO folder rips play. The source name pops in (from build 81 as a toast: ALL GAMES, HDD GAMES...). From edition 113 the three categories are glyphs in the frosted side bar (`category_layout=sidebar`, build 113): Left on the list opens each one's drawer beside it. From edition 115 each theme is its `conf_theme.cfg` and `SCR43.png`. The game list's case shows the front cover, then the back, crossfading; the info page puts its text on the other side from the list's (Adapt right, Adapt Rx left). | build 80 |
| **RIPGRID** *(built into RIPPS2 from build 91: pick it in Settings > Interface > Theme)* | Adapt's frosted screen and side bar with the games as a 4x2 cover grid, centred; the selection breathes with a soft glow and tips with the right stick, games without a cover show their serial in pixel type, and Circle cycles the sources. A 0.42 s right-stick hold turns the chosen case over to its back cover (build 97; it stays turned), pages slide in and out on L2 / R2 or at a row's edge, the game's disc pops in as it launches, and the chosen game's name sits under the grid in RIPPS2 Sleek Bold. It ships inside the ELF, so it is no longer in this pack. | built in |

Install: copy a `thm_...` folder into a `THM` folder on your drive (USB, HDD, MMCE, memory card), as
for any OPL theme, then pick it in RIPPS2's Settings > Interface > Theme, or hold SELECT on the game
list for 4.2 seconds to step through the themes. RIPGRID and RIPFLOW are already there.

Every `conf_theme.cfg` here opens with its creation header (name, maker, created and updated dates,
credits), then the **key glossary** ([docs/key_glossary.cfg](docs/key_glossary.cfg): every key a theme can
use, as comments), then the theme. Copy the glossary into your own theme's config to keep it at hand.

### On the console
- **Hold SELECT for 4.2 seconds** on the game list to step to the next theme (a quick press still refreshes the list).
- **Right stick** tips the art: the whole info page as one plane, Adapt's case and disc, RIPGRID's chosen cover.
- **RIPGRID** (built in): the D-pad moves through the grid, a row's edge turns the page; **Circle** cycles the sources (USB, HDD, ALL GAMES...).

## Make your own

**[docs/THEME_KEYS.md](docs/THEME_KEYS.md) is the whole engine, as of RIPPS2 build 100**, all of it reachable
from a theme folder:

| | What a theme can do |
|---|---|
| **Look** | Frosted glass panels over each game's art, a full-screen frosted layer, side bars, clear glass, a cover **Grid**, RIPPS2's case with a reflection, 4:3 screenshots on 16:9, wide-crop backgrounds, towers on or off. |
| **Motion** | Right-stick tilt that moves a whole page as one sheet (or one cover), page morphs between the list and the info page, art that eases in, descriptions that roll, info-page slideshows, the source name as a toast. |
| **Fonts** | 16 font slots, your `.ttf` or RIPPS2's built-in faces, in capitals or not; the slots RIPPS2's own pages draw with, so a theme restyles menus, the category bar and the view word too. |
| **Colour** | The theme's colours, and its own **Colors and More**: colour theme (RIPPS2, Ember, Blood, Ectoplasm, Amethyst, Bone), category bar, hints, glyphs, category order. The user always gets the last word. |
| **Images** | Any of RIPPS2's own images (button glyphs, badges, loaders, the flying mark, the PS1 / PS2 logos) replaced by shipping a PNG of the same name. |
| **Sound** | A `sound/` folder with any of the 15 events (boot, cursor, confirm, page in and out, launch, disc...) and `sound/bgm.ogg` for its own music. |

## The kit

| | |
|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | The rules: read first. |
| [docs/THEME_KEYS.md](docs/THEME_KEYS.md) | Everything RIPPS2's engine does for a theme: keys, elements, fonts, effects, images, sounds. |
| [docs/THEME_ENGINE_RiptOPL.md](docs/THEME_ENGINE_RiptOPL.md) | The engine underneath (RiptOPL's reference). |
| [docs/key_glossary.cfg](docs/key_glossary.cfg) | Every key on one page, as `#` comments: the glossary at the top of each `conf_theme.cfg` here. |
| `tools/check_theme.py` | Will it load? Numbering, types, missing files, misplaced keys, values RIPPS2 knows, 8-bit images. |
| `tools/mirror_theme.py` | Draft the other-side layout of a theme. |
| `tools/png8.py` | Make every image an 8-bit palette PNG: RIPPS2 keeps those as 8-bit textures, a quarter of the VRAM. |
| `tools/gen_adapt_family.py` | Writes Adapt and Adapt Rx from one layout, each with its header and the glossary (edit it, not their `conf_theme.cfg`; set its `EDITION_DATE` when they change). |

```
python3 tools/check_theme.py themes/*
python3 tools/png8.py themes/thm_MyTheme
python3 tools/mirror_theme.py "themes/thm_Adapt" "themes/thm_Adapt Rx" "Adapt Rx"
```
Python 3, with Pillow and numpy (`pip install pillow numpy`) for `png8.py`. Then look at it for real: in
PCSX2 (System > Start File, RIPPS2.elf) with the theme on its virtual drive, or on a PS2.
