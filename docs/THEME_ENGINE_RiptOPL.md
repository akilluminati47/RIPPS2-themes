# OPL Theme Engine — Authoring Reference

This document describes the Open PS2 Loader theme format **as implemented by the parser**
(`src/themes.c`), so you can build your own themes. It covers every block type, property,
value token, and built-in asset name the engine understands, including this fork's
**`Coverflow`** render mode.

- A theme is a folder in the `THM` directory containing a **`conf_theme.cfg`** plus its
  image/font assets.
- Anything not supplied by the theme falls back to OPL's embedded defaults.
- OPL also ships two built-in themes you can study as references: the default `<OPL>` theme
  and this fork's `<Coverflow>` theme.

> Quick mental model: a theme is a flat list of **elements**, each positioned on a virtual
> **640×480** canvas. OPL scales that canvas to the real screen, and (with `scaled=1`)
> corrects for widescreen and the PS2's non-square pixels automatically.

---

## 1. File structure

`conf_theme.cfg` is a plain key/value file. Two kinds of lines exist:

- **Global (top-level) properties** — `key=value` at the start of the file.
- **Element blocks** — a `blockname:` line followed by indented `key=value` lines.

```ini
# lines starting with '#' are comments
bg_color=#182580          ; a global property

main0:                    ; an element block
	type=Background
	pattern=BG
```

Internally, a block property `foo` under block `main0` is read as the key `main0_foo`. You'll
mostly just write the indented form above.

### Block families

Element names carry a **family prefix** + an index (`<family>Main<N>` / `<family>Info<N>`). Each
family targets one screen/view and is a **per-slot override** of the base `mainN`/`infoN`: for every
slot the engine looks for the family's block and, if it's absent, falls back down a chain — so you
override only what differs and inherit the rest.

| Family (main / info) | Drawn on | Per-slot fallback chain |
|---|---|---|
| `main0…` / `info0…` | The **games** list / info — the base layout | *(none — this is the base)* |
| `appsMain0…` / `appsInfo0…` | The **apps** device list / info | → `mainN` / `infoN` |
| `favsMain0…` / `favsInfo0…` | The **Favorites** tab list / info | → `mainN` / `infoN` |
| `vcdMain0…` / `vcdInfo0…` | A device's homogeneous **PS1/VCD view**, plus every PS1 row's cover and info wherever it appears | main: → `appsMainN` → `mainN`  ·  info: → `infoN` |
| `favsVcdMain0…` / `favsVcdInfo0…` *(opt-in)* | The **Favorites PS1 view**, plus PS1 covers and info on the Favorites *All* shelf | main: → `vcdMainN` → `appsMainN` → `mainN`  ·  info: → `vcdInfoN` → `infoN` |
| `favsAppsMain0…` / `favsAppsInfo0…` *(opt-in)* | The **Favorites ELF view**, plus app covers and info on the Favorites *All* shelf | main: → `favsMainN` → `mainN`  ·  info: → `favsInfoN` → `infoN` |

**The VCD family** (new in this fork) lets PS1/VCD games have their own look. A device's homogeneous
PS1 view renders from `vcdMain*`. Because each `vcdMain` slot falls
back to `appsMain` — a **square** box, matching
PS1 jewel-case art — before `main`, a theme that defines *no* `vcdMain` blocks still shows PS1 games
in the square apps box. So you only add `vcdMain` blocks to make PS1 covers *differ* from apps;
`vcdInfo` falls back to the game `info` layout, preserving the rich PS1 metadata page.

**The Favorites per-kind families** (`favsVcd*`, `favsApps*`) let PS1 and app favorites look different
from the same games on their device pages — their own layout, list and cover proportions. They are
**opt-in**: a family is built only if the theme declares at least one of its blocks, and a theme that
declares none behaves exactly as before (the Favorites PS1 view keeps using `vcdMain*`, the ELF view
`favsMain*`, and the *All* shelf the `vcdMain*` / `appsMain*` covers).

- Once declared, every slot you leave out falls back along the chain in the table — the blocks that view
  used before — so you override only what differs.
- A **cover** is taken from these families only where you **declared** it. An undeclared cover slot keeps
  today's cover (the PS1 square from `vcdMain*`, the app square from `appsMain*`), never a fallback copy
  such as `favsMain`'s portrait case. This applies to `ItemCover` panels and `Coverflow` carousels, and a
  declared cover is only used where the page draws the same kind: a `Coverflow` in `favsVcdMain*` styles
  a carousel, never an `ItemCover` panel, and vice versa.
- An `ItemsList` declared in these families needs no special handling: it takes none of the four global
  list slots, and the page navigates with the list it draws.
- PS1 favorites keep sharing the PS1 cover cache and app favorites the shared one, so no extra cover
  memory is used.

#### Mixed lists: the page picks the family, each row picks its own cover

A **mixed** list holds more than one kind of media at once — the Favorites tab's *All* shelf, and a
device page under **PS2/PS1 Game Display = Mixed**. The page as a whole still renders from one family
(the base `main*` for a Mixed device page, `favsMain*` for Favorites): the background, the texts and
the `ItemsList` belong to the *page*, so they stay put while you scroll.

The **cover does not**. A PS2 case is portrait, a PS1 case and an app box are square, and forcing one
shape on all three stretches whichever kinds are not the page's own. So the cover element — the
`ItemCover` panel, the `Coverflow` carousel — is resolved **per row, by media kind**:

| Row | Cover drawn from |
|---|---|
| PS2 disc game | the page's own family (`main2` / `favsMain2` / …) |
| PS1 / VCD | `vcdMain*` (→ `appsMain*` → `main*`); on Favorites, a cover declared in `favsVcdMain*` first |
| App / ELF | `appsMain*` (→ `main*`); on Favorites, a cover declared in `favsAppsMain*` first |

Only the cover is redirected — its `width`/`height`, `overlay`/`overlay2` and `default` placeholder.
Everything else on the page is untouched, and on a single-kind page the row's kind *is* the page's
kind, so nothing is redirected at all. The same rule picks the info screen's cover from the matching
`*Info*` family. In a Coverflow carousel the cover **width** stays uniform (so spacing stays even) and
only the height follows each row's own element aspect. Every cover stands on the same **bottom edge**
as a cover of the page's own shape, so portrait and square covers share one baseline and their
reflections start together.

> The games / apps / favs families share one cover-art cache (deduplicated by `pattern`). The **PS1/VCD
> view keeps its OWN cover cache**: separate PS2 and PS1 views reuse the device's game *list* indices,
> so a shared cache would thrash covers on every toggle. A mixed list therefore draws from **two**
> caches at once — PS1 rows from the VCD one, everything else from the shared one — and both are
> warmed. The VCD family automatically
> claims its own (4th) `ItemsList` slot and a separate cover cache — one small extra cache; the rest is
> shared. (A theme needs no extra `ItemsList` block for this; it is auto-claimed via the fallback.)

### ⚠ Contiguous numbering rule

The parser reads blocks **in order starting from 0 and stops at the first gap.** If you define
`main0`, `main1`, `main3` (skipping `main2`), then `main3` is **never read**. When you remove
a block, **renumber** the ones after it so there are no holes.

---

## 2. Global properties

Put these at the top of the file (not inside a block).

### Colors (`#RRGGBB`)

| Key | Applies to |
|---|---|
| `bg_color` | Plasma/background tint (the gradient's HIGH end) |
| `plasma_blend_color` | Plasma gradient's LOW end — historically hardcoded black; omit the key (or use `#000000`) for the classic look |
| `text_color` | Default element text |
| `ui_text_color` | UI text (menus, buttons, hints) |
| `sel_text_color` | Selected-item text |

Colors are 8-bit-per-channel hex; alpha is fixed internally.

### Fonts

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default_font` | font file path | Theme's main font; falls back to the built-in font if missing. |
| `font1` … `font15` | font file path | Extra fonts; each defaults to `default_font` if not set. |
| `default_font_size` | int (px) | Size for the default font. |
| `font1_size` … `font15_size` | int (px) | Per-font sizes. |

Reference a font from an element with `font=N` (0 = default). Use `font1=builtin` to force the
embedded font for a slot.

### Other global keys

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `coverflow_cover_offset` | int (−1024…1024, default 0) | Horizontal nudge for the Coverflow carousel (see §8). |
| `use_default` | 0/1 | Use OPL's embedded default assets for anything the theme omits. |
| `use_real_height` | 0/1 | Lay out against the real screen height instead of 480. |
| `use_settings_bg` | 0/1 | Load the theme's `settings_bg.png` behind the settings menus. |

---

## 3. Common element properties

Every element block starts with `type=<ElementType>` (see §5). Most also accept these:

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x` | int or `POS_MID` | element-specific | Negative = measured from the **right** edge. `POS_MID` = horizontal center. |
| `y` | int or `POS_MID` | element-specific | Negative = measured from the **bottom** edge. `POS_MID` = vertical center. |
| `width` | int or `DIM_INF` | element-specific | `DIM_INF` = full screen width. |
| `height` | int or `DIM_INF` | element-specific | `DIM_INF` = full screen height. |
| `aligned` | `0` / `1` / `2` | element-specific | `0` = anchor top-left, `1` = center on (x, y), `2` = right-justified + vertically centered (wOPL/uOPL key; regular OPL renders it centered). |
| `scaled` | `0` / `1` | element-specific | `0` = raw pixels, `1` = ratio-correct (handles widescreen + pixel-aspect). Use `1` for images you want undistorted. |
| `color` | `#RRGGBB` | `text_color` | Text/tint color. |
| `font` | `0`…`15` | `0` | Font index (see §2). |
| `reflection` | `0` / `1` | `0` | Draw a mirrored reflection beneath the element (used by `Coverflow`). |
| `enabled` | `0` / `1` | `1` | Set `0` to skip the element without deleting the block. |
| `devices` | name list | *(none)* | **This fork.** Show the element only on the listed device pages — honored by `MenuIcon`, `ItemsList` and `HintText` (ignored elsewhere). See §5 “Per-device placement”. |

**Value tokens:** `POS_MID`, `DIM_INF` (above), and `#RRGGBB` for colors. `x`/`y` accept
negative numbers for right/bottom-relative placement.

---

## 4. Image & overlay properties

Image-type elements (`StaticImage`, `GameImage`, `Background`, `AttributeImage`, `ItemCover`,
`Coverflow`) add:

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | asset name | The image to draw (built-in name from §7, or a file in the theme folder). |
| `pattern` | cache suffix | For dynamic art: `COV` (cover), `SCR`/`SCR2` (screenshots), `ICO`, `DISC`, … |
| `count` | int | Number of cache slots for `pattern` (min 2 for `COV`). |
| `overlay` | asset name | An optional frame drawn over the image (e.g. a case/bezel). |
| `overlay_ulx`,`overlay_uly` | int | Upper-left corner of the inlaid image inside the overlay. |
| `overlay_urx`,`overlay_ury` | int | Upper-right corner. |
| `overlay_llx`,`overlay_lly` | int | Lower-left corner. |
| `overlay_lrx`,`overlay_lry` | int | Lower-right corner. |
| `overlay2` | asset name | An optional **second** overlay painted over `overlay`. Shares the element position/size; takes no corners of its own. |

The overlay corners describe where the *inner* art sits within the overlay frame, in the
element's own coordinate space (i.e. relative to `width`/`height`). They scale with the drawn
element, so the window tracks the art at any size.

`overlay2` stacks a second layer in the draw order **cover → `overlay` → `overlay2`**. Use it to
split a frame into parts that sit over a *centred* cover (e.g. a transparent plastic case in
`overlay` and foliage/decoration in `overlay2`), avoiding the off-centre window shift a single
asymmetric overlay would otherwise need. Both layers are shared across elements that name the same
asset, so a second layer costs no extra VRAM when reused.

## 5. Element types

Set with `type=`. Elements marked **item** redraw when you move the selection.

| `type=` | Renders |
|---|---|
| `Background` | Full-screen background (`pattern=BG`, or a `default=` image). Auto-added if you omit it. |
| `StaticImage` | A fixed image from `default=`. |
| `StaticText` | Fixed text from `value=`. |
| `AttributeText` *(item)* | Game metadata text — see `attribute=` in §6. |
| `GameCountText` *(item)* | The number of items in the current list. |
| `GameImage` *(item)* | Dynamic art from `pattern=` (cover/screenshot/…) with `default=` fallback. |
| `AttributeImage` *(item)* | Badge image chosen by a game attribute — see §6. |
| `MenuIcon` | The current device/menu icon. |
| `MenuText` | The current menu name with left/right arrows. |
| `ItemsList` *(item)* | The scrolling list of games/apps. (Auto-added if omitted.) |
| `ItemIcon` *(item)* | The selected item's icon: a `GameImage` bound to the `ICO` cache (64×64 by default). Per-row list icons come from the `ItemsList`'s own `decorator=` instead. |
| `ItemCover` *(item)* | The selected item's cover, with optional `overlay`. |
| `ItemText` *(item)* | The selected item's startup filename. |
| `HintText` | Button hints for the list screen. |
| `InfoHintText` | Button hints for the info screen. |
| `LoadingIcon` | The animated loading spinner. |
| `BdmIndex` | The block-device mode indicator. |
| `Coverflow` *(item)* | **This fork:** a cover-art carousel (see §8). |

Elements are drawn in the order the theme declares them, with one exception: every `ItemText` is
moved to the end of its screen's list, so the selected item's startup filename is never painted over by
art declared after it.

Images keyed on the **`ICO`** suffix — an `ItemIcon`, a `GameImage` with `pattern=ICO`, or an
`ItemsList` with `decorator=ICO` — are the theme's disc art. The user can hide them with **Disc Artwork**
(*Settings → Interface → Artwork Settings*, on by default), and that removes the element's `default=`
image as well, so plan a layout that still reads without them. Art keyed on any other suffix, such
as `COV` covers and `BG` backgrounds, is unaffected; a `Background` with `pattern=ICO` is hidden too.

### Text element extras

| Property | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | `StaticText` | The literal string to show. |
| `attribute` | `AttributeText`, `AttributeImage` | The metadata key (§6). |
| `display` | text | `0` = always (label + value), `1` = only when the value exists, `2` = value only (no label). |
| `wrap` | text | `1` = word-wrap within `width`/`height`. |
| `show_run` | `InfoHintText` | **This fork:** `0` hides the Run hint, for a theme that draws its own launch prompt. Back is always shown. Default `1`. |
| `title` | `AttributeText` | Override the auto label for the attribute. |

**Long text never draws over other elements (*this fork*).** When a theme loads, each single-line text
element (`StaticText`, `AttributeText`, `ItemText`, the game count) and each `ItemsList` works out how
far its text can run on its row before it reaches another element of the same screen, or the screen
edge. Text longer than that scrolls inside the space, one character at a time, pausing at each end. In a
list only the highlighted row scrolls; the other rows end in "…".

- An element the text **starts inside** (a banner or panel you draw the text on) doesn't count; only
  what the text would run **into** does.
- A `width` you set still limits the text. It now scrolls there instead of being cut off.
- Centred text gets the same room on both sides.
- `wrap=1` text keeps wrapping as before.
- An image with no `width`/`height` is sized from its `default` image. A cover (`GameImage`) with
  neither is treated as 140×200.
- If the space works out smaller than about three characters, the element is drawn exactly as before.

### List extras

| Property | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `decorator` | `ItemsList` | A `GameImage` pattern name to draw as per-row icons. |

### Per-device placement (`devices=`) — *this fork*

Normally one `MenuIcon`, one `ItemsList` and one `HintText` serve **every** device page, so they
share a single position. `devices=` lets a theme place them differently per device: an element
with the key draws **only** on the listed pages, and an unfiltered element of the same type
automatically stands down there (no key needed on it), staying the default everywhere else.

```ini
# The shared icon spot, used by every page not claimed below.
main3:
type=MenuIcon
x=POS_MID
y=400

# On the MMCE and APA-HDD pages, pin the icon top-right instead.
main4:
type=MenuIcon
devices=mmce,hdd
x=-40
y=24
```

**Device names** (comma-separated, case-insensitive):

| Name | Page |
|---|---|
| `usb` | USB mass storage (any slot) |
| `ilink` | iLink / FireWire |
| `mx4sio` | MX4SIO |
| `hdd_bd` | Internal HDD, exFAT (BDM) |
| `hdd` | Internal HDD, APA/PFS |
| `eth` | Network (SMB) |
| `smb` | Alias of `eth` |
| `mmce` | MMCE / memory-card emulator |
| `udpbd` | UDPBD network boot |
| `udpfs` | UDPFS network boot |
| `app` | The Apps tab |
| `fav` | The Favorites tab |
| `bdm` | The generic BDM page before its driver is identified (auto/manual start) |

Rules worth knowing:

- **Only `MenuIcon`, `ItemsList` and `HintText`** honor the key; on other element types it parses
  but has no effect.
- Matching follows the page's **visible device icon**, so a BDM page counts as `usb`/`mx4sio`/…
  once its driver is identified, and as `bdm` before that. In the PS1/VCD (L3) view the page keeps
  the device's identity — filters keep working there via the `vcdMain*` family.
- A filtered `ItemsList` is an **override**: it does not consume one of the theme's ItemsList
  slots (games/apps/favs/VCD, claimed in file order — see §1), and navigation/paging automatically
  follows whichever list is drawn. Give it its own `x`/`y`/`height` (its row count comes from
  `height`); `decorator=` works as usual.
- **Keep one unfiltered `ItemsList`.** If *every* list in the theme carries `devices=`, OPL adds a
  plain default list (373×316 at 42,42) on the pages nothing covers — navigation always needs a
  list — and it won't match your layout.
- Unknown device names are logged and skipped; if nothing valid remains, the element behaves as if
  the key were absent (shared placement) rather than disappearing.
- Two filtered elements of the same type may list different devices; listing the **same** device
  twice draws both — that's an authoring error, not a picker.
- Themes without the key are untouched — the filter only activates when `devices=` appears.

### Using RiptOPL themes on regular OPL

RiptOPL themes are designed to load on regular/upstream OPL and degrade gracefully — one theme can
serve both. Regular OPL's parser never aborts on fork content: keys it doesn't know (`devices=`,
`reflection_offset`, `overlay2`, `plasma_blend_color`, the entire `favsMain*`, `vcdMain*`,
`favsVcdMain*` and `favsAppsMain*` families…) are simply never read, and unknown element types (`Coverflow`) are skipped without
stopping the parse. What to expect there:

- **Invisible:** all pure-key extras above — regular OPL renders the theme as if they weren't
  written.
- **Cosmetic:** `aligned=2` renders centered; `#Size`/`#DiscType`/`#System` attributes and the
  Coverflow carousel are silently absent.
- **Ugly but harmless:** `devices=` layouts — regular OPL draws *every* `MenuIcon`/`HintText` block
  on *every* page (overlapping), and treats a second `ItemsList` as the apps list while still
  drawing it on the games screen. Per-device layouts are effectively RiptOPL-only.
- **⚠ The one rule:** **always include one plain (unfiltered) `ItemsList`**. A theme with none —
  e.g. a Coverflow-only theme, or one where every list carries `devices=` — *crashes regular OPL on
  the first scroll* (a latent upstream bug in its default-list repair; RiptOPL fixed it on our
  side). Ship the plain list and the theme is safe everywhere.

---

## 6. `attribute=` values

### AttributeText (metadata text)

`Title`, `Developer`, `Description`, `Genre`, `Release`, `#Size` (the `#Size` value renders
with a `MiB` suffix). Labels are auto-localized; override with `title=`.

### AttributeImage (badge chosen by value)

A per-game **attribute** picks which glyph to draw. Where that glyph comes from depends on the theme:

* **Built-in `<OPL>` theme** (no theme folder) — draws the *embedded* glyph whose internal name equals
  the value, e.g. `#System=PS2` → the built-in `PS2`, `#Media=CD` → `CD`, `#Format=ISO` → `ISO`.
  Attributes with no embedded glyph (e.g. `#DiscType`) draw nothing on the built-in theme.
* **Disk theme** — loads **`<value>_<attribute>.png`** from the theme folder — *value first, then the
  attribute* (the same `<name>_<suffix>` shape cover art uses, e.g. `<id>_COV.png`). So `#System=PS2`
  → `PS2_#System.png`, `#Media=CD` → `CD_#Media.png`, `#DiscType=PS2DVD` → `PS2DVD_#DiscType.png`.

> ⚠️ The disk-theme file is **`<value>_<attribute>`**, *not* `<attribute>_<value>`. `PS2DVD_#DiscType.png`
> is correct; `#DiscType_PS2DVD.png` is never read. (The `#` is a literal character in the filename, and
> the extension must be lower-case **`.png`** — the PS2 HDD's filesystem is case-sensitive.)

Metadata attributes OPL sets automatically per game — on **every device** (USB/BDM, SMB, MMCE and the
internal HDD/HDL, including their PS1/VCD lists):

| `attribute=` | Value(s) OPL sets | Built-in glyph | Disk-theme file |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#System` | `PS1`, `PS2` | `PS1`, `PS2` | `PS1_#System.png`, `PS2_#System.png` |
| `#Media` | `CD`, `DVD` | `CD`, `DVD`, `APP` | `CD_#Media.png`, `DVD_#Media.png` |
| `#Format` | `ISO`, `ZSO`, `VCD`, `UL`, `ELF`, `HDL` | same names | `ISO_#Format.png`, `VCD_#Format.png`, … |
| `#DiscType` | `PS1CD`, `PS2CD`, `PS2DVD` | *(none — supply your own)* | `PS1CD_#DiscType.png`, `PS2CD_#DiscType.png`, `PS2DVD_#DiscType.png` |
| `#Size` | a byte count *(use with `AttributeText`, renders as `… MiB`)* | — | — |

Compatibility attributes whose value is *already* a full glyph name — `Vmode`, `Aspect`, `Scan`,
`Players`, `Rating` (e.g. `Vmode_ntsc`, `Aspect_w`, `Scan_480p`, `Rating_3`) — follow the same rules:
the built-in theme draws the matching embedded glyph, a disk theme uses `<value>_<attribute>.png`.

#### `#DiscType` worked example *(issue #49)*

`#System` says PS1 vs PS2 and `#Media` says CD vs DVD, but PS1-CD and PS2-CD both report `#Media=CD`, so
one `#Media` glyph can't tell them apart. `#DiscType` collapses console + media into a single token so a
theme can show **one** disc glyph per kind. There are no built-in `#DiscType` glyphs — a disk theme
supplies its own. In your theme's `conf_theme.cfg`, add an element to the page you want it on. The
`mainN` / `infoN` indices must be **contiguous** (the parser stops at the first gap), so use the next
free number — if your theme already has `main0`…`main8`, add `main9`:

```
main9:
	type=AttributeImage
	attribute=#DiscType
	x=55
	y=-252
	width=32
	height=16
```

Then drop three PNGs **in the theme folder, next to `conf_theme.cfg`**:

* `PS1CD_#DiscType.png`
* `PS2CD_#DiscType.png`
* `PS2DVD_#DiscType.png`

(Position with `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` — negative `x`/`y` anchor from the right/bottom edge. Copy the
coordinates from a neighbouring `AttributeImage` such as the `#Media` badge to line it up.)

---

## 7. Built-in `default=` asset names

You can point `default=`/`overlay=` at any of OPL's embedded textures (no file needed):

- **Covers / art:** `cover`, `coverapp`, `disc`, `screen`, `screens` (overlay), `missing`
- **Case overlays:** `case` (the shared frame, layer 1), `case_overlay` (layer 2, drawn over `case`), `apps_case` (legacy apps-only frame)
- **Device icons:** `usb`, `mmce`, `hdd`, `eth`, `app`, `fav`, `usb_bd`, `ilk_bd`, `m4s_bd`, `hdd_bd`, `udp_bd` (UDPBD), `udp_fs` (UDPFS)
- **BDM indicators:** `Index_0` … `Index_4`
- **Buttons:** `cross`, `circle`, `triangle`, `square`, `left`, `right`, `select`, `start`, `L3`, `R3`, `fav_mark`
- **Loading frames:** `load0` … `load7`
- **Boot logo:** `logo`, `logo0` … `logo6`
- **Backgrounds:** `incebtion` (default theme bg), `ip`
- **Format icons:** `ELF`, `HDL`, `ISO`, `ZSO`, `UL`
- **Media icons:** `APP`, `CD`, `DVD`
- **Aspect / scan / vmode / rating** sets as listed in §6.

(`settings_bg` is theme-supplied; `Device_*` indicators are deprecated/removed in this fork.)

---

## 8. The Coverflow element (this fork)

`type=Coverflow` renders the game/app list as a centered cover carousel with a reflection.
It behaves like a `GameImage` (uses the `COV` cover cache) but draws 3 or 5 covers with a
slide animation.

While the user is idle, the carousel also *prefetches* the covers just outside the visible
window (up to 4 positions each side of the selection, wrapping around the list ends), so a
scroll step reveals a cover that is usually already loaded instead of the placeholder
(issue #296). The prefetch only starts once the selection's own cover has loaded, and it is
skipped entirely on MMCE-backed items (including MMCE-sourced favorites) to keep the shared
SIO2 bus quiet — those covers still load on selection, as before.

### Per-theme properties (in `conf_theme.cfg`)

| Property | Notes |
|---|---|
| `default` | Fallback cover (e.g. `cover`, or `coverapp` for the apps list). |
| `overlay` + `overlay_*` corners | The case art drawn around each cover (e.g. `case` / `apps_case`). The corners place the cover **inside** the case frame; the engine auto-centers the visible frame and keeps it aspect-correct in both 4:3 and widescreen. |
| `reflection` | `1` to draw the mirrored reflection below each cover (alpha-faded). |
| `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` | Position and per-cover size. `width`/`height` should match your case art's pixel size so the overlay corners line up. `y` is the vertical **center of a cover of this element's own shape**. On a mixed shelf (Favorites *All*, a Mixed device page) a cover of another shape stands on that cover's **bottom edge**, so every cover rests on one baseline and the reflections line up. On a single-kind page every cover is this shape, so `y` is simply each cover's center. |

A minimal example (this fork's `<Coverflow>` theme uses values like these):

```ini
main2:
	type=Coverflow
	default=cover
	reflection=1
	y=233
	width=184
	height=256
	overlay=case
	overlay2=case_overlay
	overlay_ulx=0    overlay_uly=0    overlay_urx=184  overlay_ury=0
	overlay_llx=0    overlay_lly=256  overlay_lrx=184  overlay_lry=256
appsMain2:
	type=Coverflow
	default=coverapp
	reflection=1
	y=239
	width=184
	height=184
	overlay=case
	overlay2=case_overlay
	overlay_ulx=0    overlay_uly=0    overlay_urx=184  overlay_ury=0
	overlay_llx=0    overlay_lly=184  overlay_lrx=184  overlay_lry=184
vcdMain2:
	type=Coverflow
	default=cover
	reflection=1
	y=239
	width=184
	height=184
	overlay=case
	overlay2=case_overlay
	overlay_ulx=0    overlay_uly=0    overlay_urx=184  overlay_ury=0
	overlay_llx=0    overlay_lly=184  overlay_lrx=184  overlay_lry=184
```

Apps and PS1/VCD covers share the games frame but use a **square** element so the box matches
their square art, while games stay PS2-case **portrait**. The `vcdMain2` block above gives PS1/VCD
covers their own square element; omit it and PS1 games reuse `appsMain2` (see *Block families*). The element `width`/`height` set the box
aspect; the overlay corners (full-canvas of those dims) let the cover fill it.

More than one of these blocks is live at once on a **mixed** list — each row's cover picks the one
for its own media kind (see *Mixed lists* under *Block families*). Which trio is in play depends on
the page, because only the PS1 and app rows are redirected; the PS2 row keeps whatever the page
itself renders from:

- a **device page** set to Mixed → `main2` + `vcdMain2` + `appsMain2`
- the **Favorites** *All* shelf → `favsMain2` + `vcdMain2` + `appsMain2`, with `favsVcdMain2` /
  `favsAppsMain2` taking over the PS1 / app covers when the theme declares them

So a theme that overrides `favsMain2` should size it as its **PS2** cover, and define `vcdMain2` /
`appsMain2` for the other two kinds rather than leaving the whole shelf on one shape.

The Favorites PS1 and ELF views are homogeneous pages. With `favsVcdMain*` / `favsAppsMain*` declared,
they draw their own carousel from those blocks — its position, size and case, independent of the device
pages. For example, taller PS1 covers on Favorites only, with every device page unchanged:

```ini
favsVcdMain2:
	type=Coverflow
	default=cover
	reflection=1
	y=250
	width=200
	height=200
	overlay=case
	overlay2=case_overlay
	overlay_ulx=0    overlay_uly=0    overlay_urx=200  overlay_ury=0
	overlay_llx=0    overlay_lly=200  overlay_lrx=200  overlay_lry=200
```

Slots `favsVcdMain0`, `favsVcdMain1`, `favsVcdMain3`… are not declared here, so they fall back to
`vcdMain*` and the rest of the PS1 page looks as it did. The global Coverflow tuning below applies to
these carousels too.

This example assumes a theme that already uses Coverflow. A `Coverflow` block in **any** family makes
the whole theme a Coverflow theme: Left/Right steps through the list on every browse page and the
Coverflow Settings menu appears. Adding one only to `favsVcdMain*` in a list-based theme therefore
changes navigation on the device pages as well.

### Global Coverflow tuning (NOT in the theme)

These live in **`settings_riptopl.cfg`** and are exposed in the **Coverflow Settings** menu (shown
while a Coverflow theme is active). They apply to *any* Coverflow theme:

| Setting / key | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `coverflow_count` | 3 or 5 | Number of covers shown. |
| `coverflow_scale` | px | How much the center cover grows. |
| `coverflow_anim` | ms | Slide animation duration (0 = instant). |
| `coverflow_dim` | 0/1 | Dim the non-center covers. |

(The per-theme horizontal nudge `coverflow_cover_offset` is a global theme key — see §2.)

## 9. A note on coordinates & scaling

- All positions/sizes are authored on a **640×480** canvas; OPL scales to the active video
  mode.
- With `scaled=1`, image **widths** are corrected for widescreen and the PS2's pixel aspect,
  so a square stays square in both 4:3 and 16:9. Positions are not aspect-scaled, so layouts
  fill the wider screen naturally.
- Negative `x`/`y` and `POS_MID`/`DIM_INF` let you anchor to edges/center without hardcoding
  resolution-specific numbers.

For a complete, working reference, open the bundled `<OPL>` and `<Coverflow>` themes and the
`misc/conf_theme_OPL.cfg` / `misc/theme_coverflow.cfg` sources in the repository.
