"""Write conf_theme.cfg for the Adapt themes (Adapt, Adapt Rx) from one layout, so the shared pieces -- the
frosted screen, the side bar, the info page -- stay in step. RIPGRID is built into RIPPS2 (since build 91, as
<RIPGRID>), so it is no longer written here.

Each conf_theme.cfg opens with its creation header, then the key glossary (docs/key_glossary.cfg: every key a
RIPPS2 theme can use), then the theme itself. Change EDITION_DATE and EDITION_BUILD when the themes change.

    python3 tools/gen_adapt_family.py

Layers, back to front, on the game list and the info page alike:
  Background (each game's art, widecrop in 16:9) -> a full-screen frosted layer (blur, low tint, no
  frame) -> the side bar (a dark frosted strip and a light rule, frameless) -> the framed glass panel
  under the text -> the art and text.

The whole info page (panel, logo, badges, text, screenshots) tips with the right stick as one plane about
the page's centre; the hint row and the backdrop hold still. Adapt's cover is RIPPS2's case (case +
case_overlay, its reflection below), tipping with the disc; on the game list the case shows the front
cover, then the back (COV2), crossfading as the info page's slideshow does (slide=1, 2). The info page
sits on the other side from the game list's text: Adapt's text right, Adapt Rx's left.
